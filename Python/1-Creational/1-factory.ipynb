    "- You can use the Factory pattern to add that extra abstraction. The Factory pattern is one of the easiest patterns to understand and implement.\n",
    "- Adding an extra abstraction will also allow you to dynamically choose classes to instantiate based on some kind of logic.\n",
    "- Adding this extra abstraction also means that the complications of instantiating extra objects can now be hidden from the class or method that is using it.\n",
    "- This separation also makes your code easier to read and document.\n",
    "- The Factory pattern is really about adding that extra abstraction between the object creation and where it is used. This gives you extra options that you can more easily extend in the future."
